# Premier-League-Soccer-Match-Predictor

## Overview
Trained a machine learning model to predict premier league matches with a 66% accuracy prediction rate. This project uses various python libraries to scrape data from the web and clean such as BeautifulSoup which was then used to train the machine learning model. In order to increase the accuracy of the model, other predictors were created to contribute to more in-depth anlyses of matches to determine outcomes. While this model has plenty of room to improve its accuracy, I plan to continue experimenting with machine learning for which this project is an opportunity to hone my skills.
